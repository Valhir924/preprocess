# preprocess
A repository contains various preprocessing methods, which can be generally sorted as filter and feature engineering.  
---  
In details it has *expotional smoothing*, *polynomial smoothing*, *kalman filter*, *extended kalman filter*, *unscented kalman filter*, *wavelet transform*, *particle filter*(unimplenmented yet), *gaussian process regression*, *EMD*, *EEMD*, *CEEMDAN* and some feature engineering methods.  
---  
So far it can only perform some easy functions, as this repository is actually a combination of some existing libraries. My initial goal is to facilitate my daily use.  
---  
If you have troubles in importing many libraries to meet your command like me, go ahead and use this abridged one.  
---  
There are several demo files in it. Read before use.

Any issues will be read.
